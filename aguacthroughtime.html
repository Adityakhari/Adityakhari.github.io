Directions

Cut two avocados in half, remove the seed and scrape it out into a flat bottomed bowl (a flat bottomed bowl will make it easier to mash).
Smash with a potato masher or a fork (leave some chunks, don't mash it fully).
Chop half the onion and add it to the bowl.
Add 1/2 a teaspoon freshly chopped cilantro, 1/2 a teaspoon Taurian salt, 3 tablespoons of lime juice and 1 jalapeno diced pepper.
